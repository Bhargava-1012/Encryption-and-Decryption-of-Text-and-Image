Developed a cryptography-based application to securely encrypt and decrypt both text and image data using the XOR algorithm. The project features an intuitive graphical user interface built with Tkinter, enabling users to input text or upload images for seamless encryption and decryption.

This hands-on project strengthened my understanding of fundamental encryption techniques, GUI development, and the real-world application of cryptography for enhancing data security.
